To communicate with the Computer Vision service, call the `computervision_endpoint` function with the service URL and key. Rather than a key, you can also supply an OAuth token obtained with the AzureAuth package.

```r
library(AzureVision)

vis <- computervision_endpoint(
    url="https://accountname.cognitiveservices.azure.com/",
    key="account_key"
)
```

AzureVision supports all the Computer Vision API calls:

- `analyze` extracts visual features from the image. To obtain more detailed features, specify the `domain` and/or `feature_types` arguments as appropriate.
- `describe` attempts to provide a text description of the image.
- `detect_objects` detects objects in the image.
- `area_of_interest` attempts to find the "interesting" part of an image, meaning the most likely location of its subject.
- `tag` returns a set of words that are relevant to the content of the image. Not to be confused with the `add_tags` or `add_image_tags` functions that are part of the Custom Vision API.
- `categorize` attempts to place the image into a list of predefined categories.
- `read_text` performs optical character recognition (OCR) on the image.
- `list_computervision_domains` returns the predefined domain-specific models that can be queried by `analyze` for deeper analysis. Currently there are two domains: celebrities and landmarks.
- `make_thumbnail` generates a thumbnail of the image.

## Sample images

These are the images we'll use to illustrate how the package works.

|Filename|Description|Picture|
|:------:|:---------:|:-----:|
|`bill.jpg`|A portrait of Bill Gates|<img src="bill.jpg" width=300/>|
|`park.jpg`|A picture of a city park|<img src="park.jpg" width=300/>|
|`gettysburg.jpg`|The text of the Gettysburg Address|<img src="gettysburg.png" width=300/>|

An image to send to the endpoint can be specified as a filename, a publicly accessible Internet URL, or a raw vector. For example, these calls are equivalent, assuming the underlying image is the same:

```r
# from the Internet
analyze(vis, "https://example.com/foo.jpg")

# local file
analyze(vis, "~/pics/foo.jpg")

# read the picture into a raw vector
foo <- readBin("~/pics/foo.jpg", "raw", file.size("~/pics/foo.jpg"))
analyze(vis, foo)
```

## Calls

### `analyze`

```r
# analyze Bill's portrait
analyze(vis, "bill.jpg")
```

```
$categories
     name    score
1 people_ 0.953125
```

`analyze` has optional arguments `domain`, for choosing a domain-specific model with which to analyze the image; and `feature_types`, to specify additional details to return.

```r
analyze(vis, "bill.jpg", domain="celebrities")
```
```
