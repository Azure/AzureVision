\title{Connect to a Custom Vision predictive service}
\usage{
classification_service(endpoint, project, name)

object_detection_service(endpoint, project, name)
}
\arguments{
\item{endpoint}{A prediction endpoint object, of class \code{customvision_prediction_endpoint}.}

\item{project}{The project underlying this predictive service. Can be either an object of class \code{customvision_project}, or a string giving the ID of the project.}

\item{name}{The published name of the service.}
}

\description{
Connect to a Custom Vision predictive service
}
\details{
These functions are handles to a predictive service that was previously published from a trained model. They have \code{predict} methods defined for them.
